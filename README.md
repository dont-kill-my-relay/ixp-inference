# Infer Internet Exchange Points (IXP) between Autonomous Systems (AS)

From a path of ASes, this program infers the IXP or IXP organization used between two ASes.

Example: from this path of ASes `3356-2914-47147-197540`, the IXP inference will yield a result like `3356-ORG791-2914-ORG2634-47147-197540`. 
Meaning that, ASes `3356` and `2914` are likely to connect via an IXP belonging to the organisation identified by the number
`ORG791`.

The program needs data from [CAIDA](https://doi.org/10.21986/CAIDA.DATA.IXPS) to perform the inference.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository  
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

```bash
python ixp_infer.py aspath_file ix_asns_file ixs_file output_file
```

Where the files are the following.

`aspath_file` contains AS inferred path and is structured as follows.

```
sample_n timestamp c2g g2c e2d d2e
0 1637107200 34309-20773-8972 8972-20773-34309 4224-6939-4837-4808 4808-4837-6939-4224
1 1637107200 7018-3257-13194-61272 61272-9002-3356-7018 None 4808-4837-3356-1764
2 1637107200 3356-2914-47147-197540 197540-47147-6939-3356 None 4808-4837-6939-51765
3 1637107200 6453-16276 16276-6453-6421 60729-1273-4837-4808 4808-4837-3320-60729
```

`sample_n` and `timestamp` will be kept as they are. 
Each dash separated list is the path of AS taken, for which we should infer the IXP. 
If a path is not known, the keyword `Ç¸one` can be used instead. 
The tool was designed to infer IXP in case of Tor circuits so `c2g`, `g2c`, `e2d` and `d2e` respectively represent the 
path between client and guard, guard and client, exit and destination, and destination and exit. 

`ix_asns_file` is one `ix-asns*.jsonl` file from [CAIDA](https://publicdata.caida.org/datasets/ixps/)

`ixs_file` is one `ixs*.jsonl` file from [CAIDA](https://publicdata.caida.org/datasets/ixps/)

Both `ix_asns_file` and `ixs_file` should be selected from the same date, which should match the data for which the AS 
inference was done.

`output_file` sets the name for the result file and is optional.
